Subject: Data Quality Assessment Findings and Next Steps

Hi [Stakeholder's Name],

I hope you're doing well. I have completed the data quality assessment for the receipt, user, and brand datasets. Below are the details of the findings and the next steps.

Data Quality Assessment Findings

1. What questions do you have about the data?

Clarification on Data Definitions and Expectations: Could you provide a detailed data dictionary that defines the expected values and constraints for each column? This would help ensure that we interpret the data correctly and apply appropriate validation rules.

Business Rules Enforcement: Are there specific business rules we need to enforce for data consistency, such as acceptable ranges for totalSpent or required statuses for rewardsReceiptStatus?
Detailed Findings

Missing Values:

Receipts: Several columns have missing values, including bonusPointsEarned (575), pointsEarned (510), and totalSpent (435).

Users: Missing values in signUpSource (48), state (56), and lastLogin.$date (62).

Brands: Missing values in category (155), categoryCode (650), and topBrand (612).

Duplicate Records:

Receipts: 0 duplicate entries.
Users: 283 duplicate entries.
Brands: 0 duplicate entries.

Unique Values:

Unique User IDs in Receipts DataFrame: 258
Unique IDs in Users DataFrame: 212
Unique Barcodes in Brands DataFrame: 1,160
Date Parsing Errors:

Issues with parsing date fields like finishedDate.$date (551 errors), pointsAwardedDate.$date (582 errors), and purchaseDate.$date (448 errors).

Rewards Receipt Status Values:
The rewardsReceiptStatus field contains the following values: ['FINISHED', 'REJECTED', 'FLAGGED', 'SUBMITTED', 'PENDING']. 

Non-numeric Values:
Issues identified in 'pointsEarned' (510 NaN values) and 'totalSpent' (435 NaN values).


2. How did you discover the data quality issues?

Missing Values: Identified by checking for null values in each column across the datasets.
Duplicate Records: Detected by examining key identifiers while excluding non-hashable columns.
Invalid Data Types: Reviewed data types of each column to ensure they match the expected formats.
Invalid Date Formats: Validated date columns to ensure they contain valid date entries.
Foreign Key Violations: Cross-referenced IDs in the receipts dataset against the user and brand datasets to ensure all references are valid.

3. What do you need to know to resolve the data quality issues?

Handling Missing Data: How should we handle records with missing values? Should they be removed, or do you prefer a specific method for imputing missing values?

Invalid Foreign Key References: For records with invalid foreign key references, should we create placeholder records, or should we exclude these records from our analysis?

Addressing Invalid Values: What approach should we take for records with invalid values, such as negative totalSpent or unexpected rewardsReceiptStatus?

4. What other information would you need to help you optimize the data assets you're trying to create?

Additional Data Sources: Are there any additional data sources we can integrate to improve data completeness and accuracy?

Data Validation Rules: Could you provide more details on the specific data validation rules we should implement to prevent future data quality issues?

5. What performance and scaling concerns do you anticipate in production and how do you plan to address them?

Data Volume: Given the large volume of data, we need to ensure our data processing pipelines are optimized for performance. Partitioning the data can improve query performance and scalability.

Data Storage: We need to evaluate our current data storage solutions to ensure they can handle the increasing data volume without compromising performance. This might involve considering more scalable storage options.

System Resources: Monitoring system resources such as CPU, memory, and storage is essential to ensure they meet the demands of our data processing workloads. Implementing resource management strategies will help maintain performance.

Next Steps and Recommendations

Monitoring and Reporting: Set up regular data quality monitoring and reporting to identify and address issues promptly.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is additional information you can provide to help us proceed with the data quality improvement efforts.

Best regards,
Balasai Reddy
